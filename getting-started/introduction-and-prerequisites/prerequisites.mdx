# System Requirements & Prerequisites

Ensure your system is prepared for integrating OpenTelemetry with GORM by reviewing supported versions, necessary packages, and tooling. This preparation guarantees a smooth installation and reliable observability features.

---

## 1. Supported Go and GORM Versions

OpenTelemetry for GORM is designed to work with specific versions of Go and GORM to ensure compatibility and stability.

- **Go Version:**
  - Minimum Go version 1.18 is required.
  - Compatible up to the latest stable Go releases.

- **GORM Version:**
  - Supports GORM v1.23.x and above.
  - Ensure the version of GORM in your project matches or exceeds this to avoid integration issues.

<Check>
Verify your Go version with:
```bash
go version
```
Check your GORM version in your `go.mod` file or by running:
```bash
go list -m all | grep gorm.io/gorm
```
</Check>

## 2. Required Third-Party Packages

These dependencies must be included in your project to enable OpenTelemetry features seamlessly.

- **OpenTelemetry Go SDK:** For trace and metrics support.
- **OTLP Exporters (optional):** Allow exporting telemetry data to external backends like Jaeger or Prometheus.
- **GORM OpenTelemetry Plugin:** The plugin itself integrates tracing, metrics, and logging.

Make sure your module dependencies include these, typically handled via `go get` commands, such as:

```bash
go get go.opentelemetry.io/otel
```

Refer to the Installation guide for exact dependency installation commands.

## 3. Tooling Requirements

Prepare your development and runtime environment with the following tools:

- **Go Toolchain:** Go 1.18 or newer installed and configured.
- **Docker (optional):** Useful for running observability backends like Jaeger or Prometheus during development and testing.
- **Prometheus and Jaeger:** Commonly used for visualizing metrics and traces.

### Docker Services Examples

- You can quickly start Prometheus and Jaeger using provided docker-compose files in the samples.

```bash
docker-compose -f examples/demo/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

This command sets up Jaeger and Grafana for trace visualization.

## 4. Network and Access Requirements

- **Network Access:** Ensure your application environment can communicate with telemetry backends (e.g., Jaeger endpoint or Prometheus scraper).
- **Firewall and Ports:** Open necessary ports (e.g., 14268 for Jaeger HTTP collector, 9090 for Prometheus) to allow telemetry data flow.

## 5. Environment Preparation Checklist

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Go version">
Run `go version` to confirm you have Go 1.18 or newer.
</Step>
<Step title="Check GORM version">
Review your `go.mod` to ensure GORM >= v1.23 is used.
</Step>
<Step title="Install required dependencies">
Use `go get` commands or update `go.mod` as per installation instructions.
</Step>
<Step title="Set up telemetry backends">
Optionally start Jaeger and Prometheus via Docker to capture traces and metrics.
</Step>
<Step title="Open network ports">
Ensure ports for telemetry exporters are open for your development or production environment.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Tips

- **Mismatched Versions:** Using unsupported Go or GORM versions will cause compilation or integration failures.
- **Missing Dependencies:** Forgetting to install the OpenTelemetry SDK or exporters will prevent telemetry data from being captured or exported.
- **Closed Ports or Blocked Network:** Telemetry data may silently fail if network communication with the backend is blocked.

<Tip>
Always verify your environment matches the required versions before proceeding with installation to avoid errors that are difficult to troubleshoot later.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Do not skip setting up telemetry backends like Jaeger or Prometheus if you want to visualize and analyze your traces and metrics.
</Warning>

## 7. Next Steps

After confirming your system meets these prerequisites, proceed to the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/installation-and-configuration/installation) to set up the plugin and integrate OpenTelemetry into your GORM-powered Go application.
